      <h3>Adoption Day</h3>
      <p class="sub-text"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></i> 6 January 2018</p>
        <p>One morning a new hooman came. She put me in a carrier box and drove somewhere. I cried all the way there. When we arrived I was in my new home. The new hooman introduced me to her partner. It was very scary but they made me feel loved. They got me all these gifts and played with me and gave me lots of cuddles.</p>

      <h3>Adventure Day</h3>
        <p class="sub-text"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-plane"></i> The day I tried to run away.</p>
        <p>One day my favourite hooman allowed me to hang out in the back garden by myself. I decided to explore the world behind the fence. It was not particulary exciting. I got lost. I thought I would never find my way home but then I heard my favourite hooman's voice. I cried until she found me and took me back. I will never go exploring again.</p>

        <p>One afternoon my hoomans gave me lots of chicken and wished me happy birthday. I am still unsure exactly what it means but I hope it happens again soon. I love chicken.</p>
